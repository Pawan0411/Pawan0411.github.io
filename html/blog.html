                My note is to all 3rd years guys 2021 batch. Placements season has been reopen. So get ready to face
                different kind of challenges. This is the time when you will get various ups and downs in your life. But
                it is not necessary all will get selected/hired some
                will get hired some will get another chance in there life. Those who have achieved success at their
                first try congratulations to them, but Those who haven't achieved success, you will get another
                opportunity in life. You need to wait for the right time, don't let negative things to come in your
                mind. After all it's your mind or it's you only who is responsible for all the things, for your success
                for your failure. Rather you should not use the word "Failure" just interpret it as a "way that didn't
                worked, I need to find the different way". Yes It's possible your previous way is also correct but
                somethings life ask for perfect things too.
                It give us chance to become perfect.<br><br>

                A common situation comes in engineering students, student S has started preparing for the exam or
                interview more earlier than his classmate. Now, Student A and his classmates gave the same exam or have
                appeared for same company as according to previous records yes Student A have more marks than my
                classmate, he have done more things ae compared to his classes etc. But ultimately, his classmates get the
                job first.
                Here's the situation where student A feels like frustrated, irritated and many more. But is this
                correct? No.
                But that's how life is - The more you want something, the more you chase for something god will keep
                taking it away and that's because he has planned something more better for you.
                Student A kept preparing more and more he never gave up . Tough time only makes him more strong.
                Once again he tried for some company X but again the same thing happened his roommates where placed but
                he wasn't.<br><br>

                He was happy for them, it wasn't jealousy, we think we are jealous but that feeling was
                different that's sadness when you try really hard and you don't get things.
                It hurts when you work so hard but god keeps giving to someone who already have something, it's normal
                to feel upset and sad but don't let yourself soak in it.<br><br>

                Because God makes difficult situation more difficult just to see your patience and how much you are
                determined towards working hard.<br><br>

                so just remember the more rejection you get chances of your success increases. don't let your failure
                define you. cut all the contacts with people who criticize you and makes you feel demotivated.<br><br>

                <b>One lesson : "sometimes late success is a blessing in disguise".</b><br><br>

                And yes finally Student A get job after all his struggle and belive me it will always something more than
                the companies you got rejected.<br><br>

                All the failure and struggles are basically a blessing it does not only gives you success it makes you a
                strong person too.<br><br>

                That's all Guys,<br>
                Dont stop when you are tired stop when you are done.<br>

                <b> All the best for your career!</b>
